## Important information

**Warning: I am not responsible for bricking your devices. Flash at your own risk**

**A basic firmware based on Arduino is available in [ota_secure](ota_secure/readme.md) to check if your hardware is compatible**

**I recommend making a complete [backup](backup/readme.md) of your flash before doing anything**
**I've upload my factory backup (7.0.17); it might be useful. Backup tested and approved, it works**

## Teardown

> Version i've bought : https://a.aliexpress.com/_EH3UQ0u
> Maybe hardware is different with others vendor, but original firmware work on my version so...

-   **MCU**: ESP8266

## Screen hardware configuration

### Display specifications

-   **Controller**: ST7789
-   **Resolution**: 240x240 pixels
-   **Color Format**: RGB565 (16-bit color)
-   **Interface**: SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
-   **SPI Speed**: 80 MHz
-   **Rotation**: Upside-down for cube display

### Pin wiring

The display is connected to the ESP8266 using the following GPIO pins:

| Function      | GPIO Pin | Description                                           |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **MOSI**      | GPIO 13  | SPI Master Out Slave In (data from ESP8266 to screen) |
| **SCK**       | GPIO 14  | SPI Clock                                             |
| **CS**        | GPIO 2   | Chip Select (Active HIGH)                             |
| **DC**        | GPIO 0   | Data/Command select (LOW=command, HIGH=data)          |
| **RST**       | GPIO 15  | Reset pin                                             |
| **Backlight** | GPIO 5   | Backlight control (Active LOW)                        |

### Important configuration details

**Chip select (CS) polarity**: This board uses **active-high** CS, which is non-standard. Most SPI displays use active-low CS. The CS pin must be driven HIGH to select the display

**SPI mode**: SPI Mode 0 (CPOL=0, CPHA=0)

**Data/command pin**: LOW for commands, HIGH for data

**Backlight**: Active-low control - set GPIO 5 LOW to turn the backlight on, HIGH to turn it off

## How the screen works

### Initialization sequence

1. **Backlight control**: GPIO 5 is set as output and driven LOW to turn on the backlight
2. **Hardware reset**: The RST pin (GPIO 15) is toggled to reset the ST7789 controller
3. **SPI bus setup**: Hardware SPI is initialized with 80 MHz clock speed and Mode 0
4. **Display controller init**: The ST7789 is configured using a vendor-specific initialization sequence that includes:
    - Sleep out (0x11)
    - Porch settings (0xB2)
    - Tearing effect on (0x35)
    - Memory access control/MADCTL (0x36)
    - Color mode to 16-bit RGB565 (0x3A)
    - Various power control settings (0xB7, 0xBB, 0xC0-0xC6, 0xD0, 0xD6)
    - Gamma correction settings (0xE0, 0xE1, 0xE4)
    - Display inversion on (0x21)
    - Display on (0x29)
    - Full window setup and RAMWR command (0x2A, 0x2B, 0x2C)
5. **Rotation aplied**: Display rotation is set to mode 4 for proper orientation with cube

### Communication protocol

The display uses **SPI** protocol for communication:

1. **Chip select**: CS is driven HIGH to select the display
2. **Command/data mode**: The DC pin indicates whether the data on MOSI is a command (DC=LOW) or pixel data (DC=HIGH)
3. **Data transfer**: Data is shifted out on the MOSI pin, synchronized with the SCK clock signal
4. **Chip deselect**: CS can be kept HIGH during continuous operations for better performance, or dropped LOW between operations

### Drawing to the screen

The firmware uses the Arduino_GFX library with a custom ESP8266SPIWithCustomCS bus driver that handles the active-high CS polarity. Graphics operations:

1. **Begin write**: Assert CS (set HIGH)
2. **Write commands**: Set DC LOW, send command bytes via SPI
3. **Write data**: Set DC HIGH, send pixel data via SPI
4. **End write**: Optionally deassert CS (set LOW) - can be kept asserted for continuous operations

### Color format

Colors are encoded in RGB565 format (16-bit):

-   Red: 5 bits (bits 15-11)
-   Green: 6 bits (bits 10-5)
-   Blue: 5 bits (bits 4-0)

Example colors:

-   Black: 0x0000
-   White: 0xFFFF
-   Red: 0xF800
-   Green: 0x07E0
-   Blue: 0x001F

### Performance optimizations

-   **High SPI speed**: 80 MHz clock for fast data transfer
-   **CS kept asserted**: During continuous operations, CS stays HIGH to reduce overhead
-   **Hardware SPI**: Uses ESP8266's hardware SPI peripheral for efficient transfers
-   **Batch writes**: Multiple operations are batched between beginWrite/endWrite calls
-   **Direct frame buffer writes**: GIF frames are streamed directly to avoid intermediate buffering

## What's next ?

Okay, now we have a minimal firmware that works.

I really like ESP devices and I really enjoy working with ESP-IDF, so I’m planning ~~if possible (I haven’t checked compatibility yet, I’m still new to this world)~~ to create a firmware close to the original one in terms of features, but fully open source ofc \o/

Since ESP IDF is not compatible with esp8266, i'm going to build the firmware on top of [plateformIO](https://platformio.org/)

That’s the project, at least

## PlateformIO Firmware

This is the "real" firmware I want to improve, with clean and reliable code

The ota_secure one is just a POC of working screen and wifi to ensure the project is possible, crappy code & co

WIP

### Build and upload code

```bash
pio run --target upload
```

### Build and upload FS

```bash
pio run --target uploadfs
